# Instagram Style Photo Collage : Project

### Photo collage is usually very common in nowadays. Everyone makes it as per requirement, So we thought why not to build the same using libraries of the Python programming language.

#### Libraries Used :
* ` numpy ` 
* ` cv2 `
* ` pandas `
* ` matplotlib `


In this, we will build a photo collage using 5 images of pokemon as given in the dataset.

**Sample Image -** <br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47782249/85403014-4f579980-b57a-11ea-97d7-52f321007028.jpg" width = 150px, height =150px>

We can also make more changes to add more collage layouts and to make more decorative. It depends on us.
